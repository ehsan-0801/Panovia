# Panovia — Roles, Routes & API Access

This document describes the **5 system roles**, what each can do, and exactly
which **frontend routes** and **backend API endpoints** each role may access.

> Source of truth: `backend/src/lib/permissions.ts` (mirrored in
> `frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts`). The backend enforces every rule; the
> frontend only hides what you can't use.

## 1. Roles

| Role | Key | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Admin** | `admin` | Full control of the system — all data, users and settings. The first registered user becomes Admin. |
| **Inventory Manager** | `inventory_manager` | Owns inventory: products (add/edit, no delete), categories, suppliers and purchasing. |
| **Sales Manager** | `sales_manager` | Owns the customer side: customers and sales/invoicing. |
| **Accountant** | `accountant` | Read-only on transactions; views & exports financial reports. |
| **Viewer** | `viewer` | Read-only across the app. Default role for new (invited) users. |

Actions are **C**reate · **R**ead · **U**pdate · **D**elete.
`CRUD` = all four · `Create/Edit` = create + read + update (no delete) · `View` = read-only · `—` = no access.

## 3. Frontend Routes

### Public (no login, always light theme)
| Route | Page |
|-------|------|
| `/` | Landing / marketing home |
| `/features` | Features |
| `/pricing` | Pricing |
| `/about` | About |
| `/contact` | Contact |

### Authentication
| Route | Page |
|-------|------|
| `/login` | Sign in |
| `/register` | Create account (first user → Admin) |
| `/forgot-password` | Request reset link |
| `/reset-password` | Set new password (from email link) |

### Application (login required) — ✅ = can open, 👁 = read-only view, — = hidden/redirected
| Route | Admin | Inventory | Sales | Accountant | Viewer |
|-------|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|:----------:|:------:|
| `/dashboard` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/products` (list) | ✅ | ✅ | 👁 | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/products/new` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `/products/:id` (detail) | ✅ | ✅ | 👁 | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/products/:id/edit` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `/categories` (+ `/new`, `/:id/edit`) | ✅ | ✅ (no delete) | 👁 | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/customers` (list/detail) | ✅ | 👁 | ✅ | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/customers/new`, `/:id/edit` | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | — |
| `/suppliers` (list/detail) | ✅ | ✅ | 👁 | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/suppliers/new`, `/:id/edit` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `/purchases` (list/detail) | ✅ | ✅ | 👁 | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/purchases/new`, `/:id/edit` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `/sales` (list/detail) | ✅ | 👁 | ✅ | 👁 | 👁 |
| `/sales/new`, `/:id/edit` | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | — |
| `/reports` | ✅ | ✅* | ✅* | ✅* | ✅* |
| `/accounts` (finance summary + ledger) | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | — |
| `/users` (+ `/new`, `/:id/edit`) | ✅ | — | — | — | — |
| `/roles` | ✅ | — | — | — | — |
| `/settings` · `/settings/company` | ✅ | — | — | — | — |
| `/settings/profile` · `/settings/security` · `/profile` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

\* Reports page only shows the report categories that role is allowed to open (see matrix above). Deleting a record is Admin-only for every module; `delete` actions never appear for other roles.

Routes a role can't access are guarded by `RequirePermission` and redirect to `/dashboard`. Sidebar items are hidden when the role lacks read access to that module.

## 5. Enforcement notes

- **Server-side first:** every write is gated by `requirePermission(module, action)` middleware in the API; the role comes from `public.users.role`, loaded on each request. A blocked call returns **403**.
- **UI mirrors, never trusts:** the frontend hides buttons/routes a role can't use, but the API is the real gate.
- **Stock & dues:** sales validate stock and adjust customer dues transactionally; deleting/editing reverses the effects (Admin only for delete).
- **Audit:** create/update/delete and logins are written to `activity_logs` and surfaced on detail pages' Activity tab (Admin sees the global log).
